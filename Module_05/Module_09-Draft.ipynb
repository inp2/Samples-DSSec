This measure should be directly aligned with the higher level goals. For example: an intrusion detection system typically measures success `recall`. `recall` is the ability of a model to find all the relevant cases within the data. In intrusion detection, `recall` can be thought as of a model's ablity to find all the malicious intrusions. The other measurement is `precision`. When we increase recall we also decrease `precision`. If we labeled all the intrusions as malicious we would have 100% `recall`, however low `precision`. `Precision` is the ability to the model to identify only the relevant data points. In intrusion detection, label all the intrusions the model classifies are malicious that are not. \n",
