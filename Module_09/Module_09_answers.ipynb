    "There are several ways to approach this classification problem taking into consideration this unbalance:\n",
    "* Collect more data? Nice strategy but not applicable in this case\n",
    "* Changing the performance metric:\n",
    "    * Use the confusio nmatrix to calculate Precision, Recall\n",
    "    * F1score (weighted average of precision recall)\n",
    "    * Use Kappa - which is a classification accuracy normalized by the imbalance of the classes in the data\n",
    "    * ROC curves - calculates sensitivity/specificity ratio.\n",
    "* Resampling the dataset\n",
    "    * Essentially this is a method that will process the data to have an approximate 50-50 ratio.\n",
    "    * One way to achieve this is by OVER-sampling, which is adding copies of the under-represented class (better when you have little data)\n",
    "    * Another is UNDER-sampling, which deletes instances from the over-represented class (better when he have lot's of data)"
